    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Samsa or samosa is an independent dish, similar to a pie, of arbitrary (square, triangular or most often rounded) shape with filling.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>For the test:
            <ul>
                <li>Wheat flour - 0.5 kg</li>
                <li>Butter - 100 g</li>
                <li>Water - 250 ml</li>
                <li>Salt - 1 teaspoon</li>
                <li>Chicken egg - 1 pc.</li>
            </ul>
            
        </li>
        <li>For filling:
            <ul>
                <li>Minced meat - 0.6 kg</li>
                <li>Onions - 2 pcs.</li>
                <li>Salt - 0.5 teaspoon</li>
                <li>Ground black pepper - to taste</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare unleavened dough for samsa. Use salt in an aqueous solution. Add the flour, kneading with your hands. Knead the dough until smooth. add the oil. Knead again and let the film rest for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Prepare the dough for the samsa. Melt the butter (50 g) and let it cool down a little. Dilute the drinking water in gold. Beat the egg lightly with a whisk. Chop the remaining butter and leave it at a high temperature so that it becomes soft.</li>
        <li>Add the melted butter-salt and boiling water to the egg, mix. Then gradually add the sifted flour, stirring constantly. When the samsa dough thickens, put it on the table. Knead until it becomes smooth and elastic. Divide it into three equal parts.</li>
        <li>Form each mold in a ball, cover with a damp towel and leave on the table for 30-40 minutes. Prepare the samsa dough. Put the meat through a meat grinder. Peel and finely chop the onion. Add to the meat, season with cumin, salt and pepper. Switch over.</li>
        <li>Take a ball of dough and roll it out into a thin layer 2 mm thick on a starch-sprinkled table, shaping the shape. Do this with other balls of samsa dough.</li>
        <li>Brush each layer of dough with soft butter. Before laying the dough layer on top, let the oil from the lower layer harden a little. Put the patches in tight rolls.</li>
        <li>Cut each piece into 1.5 cm thick slices. Put it in the freezer for 15-20 minutes so that the oil freezes. Roll out the unleavened dough into a thin layer.</li>
        <li>Then place a little unleavened dough on a slice of a cooled piece of spread dough (it will only hold the liquids together so that they do not spread out). Roll out the tortillas (due to the hardened oil, they will be very convenient to roll out without flour or starch).</li>
        <li>Put 1 tbsp of filling on the dough. Form a triangular patty. Transfer to a baking sheet lined with baking paper, seam down. Brush with the yolk whipped with milk. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake for 30 minutes at 200 °C.</li>
    </ol>
